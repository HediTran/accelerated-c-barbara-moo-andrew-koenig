9-1: FULL set Student_info, grade, median, main
9-2: change function std::string name() const in class Student_info to std::string name() 
-> required changes in bool compare function
Change bool compare (const Student_info&, const Student_info&) to bool compare (Student_info&, Student_info&) 
because function compare call function name(). If function compare operate on const Student_info Object -> it can't call nonconst name() function to operate on that Object
(NOTE: Change compare and name function in Student_infov2.cpp, Student_infov2.h)
9-3: trigger: try, catch: catch and e.what()
9-4: main_Unit4_9_4 with v2 files
9-5: FULL set (except median)
9-6: FULL set (except median)
9-7: FULL set
